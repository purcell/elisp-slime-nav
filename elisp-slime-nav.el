;;; elisp-slime-nav.el --- Make M-. and M-, work in elisp like they do in slime
;;
;; Author: Steve Purcell <steve@sanityinc.com>
;; Keywords: navigation slime elisp emacs-lisp
;; URL: https://github.com/purcell/elisp-slime-nav
;; Version: DEV
;;
;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides Slime's convenient "M-." and "M-," navigation
;; in `emacs-lisp-mode', together with an elisp equivalent of
;; `slime-describe-symbol', bound by default to `C-c C-d d`.
;;
;; When the main functions are given a prefix argument, they will
;; prompt for the symbol upon which to operate.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;;   (require 'elisp-slime-nav)
;;   (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'elisp-slime-nav-mode)
;;
;; When installing from an ELPA package, this hook is added for you.
;;
;; Known issues:
;;
;;   When navigating into Emacs' C source, "M-," will not be bound to
;;   the same command, but "M-*" will typically do the trick.
;;
